# Overview
The purpose of this project is to give Dana a webpage that contains a dynamic table of the collected data on UFOs. 

# Results
By using the filters on the page a user can do a search that filters the data on the table seen by the pictures. There are 5 filters that can be used to properly filter the data. After inputting in the filters the user needs to press enter to filter.

# Summary

The drawbacks of this webpage is that the data isn't current so there is no data past 2010.
For further development more data should be added/updated and a page could be made for scrapping articles on ufos
